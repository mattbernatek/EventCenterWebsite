            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>After years spent running private clubs in London and New York, Matt Hollinger found himself craving something different — something more personal. The polished exclusivity of places like The Arts Club or The Garrick had their charm, but what he missed most was connection — the laughter between friends, the quiet magic of a late-night piano, the feeling that everyone belonged. When he arrived in Durham, he realized this city had exactly the kind of soul those big cities had lost: thoughtful people, artists, and dreamers who still valued a good conversation over a well-made drink.</p>
            <p>The Resonance Piano Lounge was born from that discovery — a place where sophistication meets comfort, and where the music does the talking. Inspired by the elegance of the world's finest private clubs but stripped of their pretense, Matt envisioned a space that welcomes everyone, whether they're closing a deal over lunch or singing along to show tunes on a Thursday night. It's not about status here; it's about vibe — that shared heartbeat that happens when a melody, a cocktail, and good company find the same rhythm.</p>
