            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>After years spent running private clubs in London and New York, Matt Hollinger found himself craving something different — something more personal. The polished exclusivity of places like The Arts Club or The Garrick had their charm, but what he missed most was connection — the laughter between friends, the quiet magic of a late-night piano, the feeling that everyone belonged. When he arrived in Durham, he realized this city had exactly the kind of soul those big cities had lost: thoughtful people, artists, and dreamers who still valued a good conversation over a well-made drink.</p>
            <p>The Resonance Piano Lounge was born from that discovery — a place where sophistication meets comfort, and where the music does the talking. Inspired by the elegance of the world's finest private clubs but stripped of their pretense, Matt envisioned a space that welcomes everyone, whether they're closing a deal over lunch or singing along to show tunes on a Thursday night. It's not about status here; it's about vibe — that shared heartbeat that happens when a melody, a cocktail, and good company find the same rhythm.</p>

                <h3>Matt Hollinger</h3>
                <p class="role">Founder & Creative Director</p>
                <p>Matt spent the early part of his career quietly behind the scenes of some of London's and New York's most exclusive private clubs, where his role was always about shaping atmosphere rather than being the centre of attention. Eventually, though, he realised he was longing for a place with warmth and accessibility rather than velvet ropes and restricted access. When he moved to Durham and imagined what would become The Resonance Piano Lounge: a space inspired by the world's finest clubs but open to all. As Founder & Creative Director, Matt still curates everything from the lighting to the playlist — always asking, “Does this feel right?”</p>

                <h3>Marcus Green</h3>
                <p class="role">Head Bartender</p>
                <p>Marcus grew up in the Triangle and travelled through major cities working craft-cocktail bars, from Chicago lofts to Los Angeles rooftops — but he always came home to North Carolina. He joined The Resonance knowing that the right drink doesn’t need to shout: it just needs to sing. As Head Bartender, Marcus blends his worldly experience with local taste, creating signature cocktails that are rooted in this region yet polished enough for a night at a top club. His favourite job? Spotting someone comfortable on a bar stool at five o’clock, just relaxing into the sound of the piano.</p>

                <h3>Elliot Harper</h3>
                <p class="role">Resident Pianist</p>
                <p>Elliot studied at the Duke University Department of Music, where he honed his craft in every genre from classical études to jazz improvisation. After touring countless venues across the country, he realised his music felt most alive when he could share joy with everyday people — and that's exactly what brought him to The Resonance. Elliot's favourite part of his job? That moment when the house-lights soften, the key changes softly, and someone in the audience leans forward to just listen. Whether he's playing a Broadway favourite, a ragtime piece or a nighttime jazz standard, his aim is simple: “Let's make someone smile.”.</p>

                <h3>Priya Patel</h3>
                <p class="role">Events Director</p>
                <p>Born and raised in Durham, Priya embodies the city's rich blend of cultures and community spirit. With a degree in Arts Management and a background coordinating gallery events and theatre evenings, Priya now oversees the special nights at The Resonance — from themed sing-alongs to private bookings and live-band evenings. She says her guiding question is always: “What memory will someone leave with?” And when the candles are lit, the piano begins, and laughter begins to fill the room, Priya quietly checks: “Yes — that's it!”</p>
